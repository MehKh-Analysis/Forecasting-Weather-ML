🌍 Weather Forecasting with Machine Learning ( Time Series )

📌 About the Project
This project applies time series analysis and machine learning models to forecast Delhi’s weather (2013-2017). The dataset contains temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure, making it suitable for predictive modeling.

📌 Key Features

✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) → Visualizing trends & seasonality.

✔ Feature Engineering → Creating lag features to improve ML predictions.

✔ Machine Learning Models → Using XGBoost & Random Forest to forecast weather.

✔ Time Series Techniques → Comparing Lag Features & Expanding Window Approaches.

✔ Performance Evaluation → Comparing RMSE, MAE, and MAPE across models.

📌 Models Implemented

✅ XGBoost with Lag Features
✅ XGBoost with Expanding Window
✅ Random Forest Regressor
